## Implementation
The Asset manager contains two subsystems:
1. The **Audit Tool**, which BDRC will deploy to the field, for DPEs. The audit tool is a standalone application which can run on Windows 7 - 10, or Mac OS 10.12 (?) or newer. The Audit tool allows BDRC to accept or reject scanning work while the scanning staff is still present. It also allows assembling a package which the field can upload for further processing.
2. The **Asset Manager** is a web application which allows BDRC to process the uploaded packages, creating content streams which:
    + BDRC archives for preservation,
    + the BDRC web application can view
    + updates BDRC metadata.
