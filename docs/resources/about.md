# Building this document
This website was built under the following environment:
- Python 3.7.1
- mkdocs 1.0.4
- mkdocs-cinder 0.1.4
- - Asset Manager Git hub project pages `update from gh-pages` option is selected, because we use an outside theme, not a GH Jekyll theme.

The `mkdocs-windmill` theme was considered, but it doesn't work with `mkdocs 1.0`
[mkdocs-windmill Issue #30](https://github.com/gristlabs/mkdocs-windmill/issues/30)

The documents are largely edited in [Atom](https://atom.io), because of its awesome image capturing capability, and its generally better Makrdown preview than pyCharm (where most of the Python development is being done.)
